REMOTE LEARNING IN THIS PANDEMIC

Recent situation

 COVID-19 spread has already pointed out the economic hardships caused by the outbreak ensuing the lockdown. They have impacted students and teachers as well. State governments and higher education regulatory bodies such as the All India Council for Technical Education, or AICTE, have taken steps to ensure that private institutions do not increase the fee in academic year of 2020-21. Many private schools, facing the cash-crush or claiming to, have stopped paying teachers creating yet another group that is suffering financially due to the lockdown and the situation is going worse every day.
No-one had ever imagined of such a catastrophic situation. This pandemic has shown all the inadequacies of our Educational as well as Economic system. So, it is the need of the hour to bring revolution and new resolution in our educational section.
As we are well aware about the online education that has come up with highlighting colors portraying that learning should never stop. This can be seen in the underlying examples.
	In Argentina, they have Educ.ar as an educational portal of the Ministry of Education of Argentina aimed at providing curated digital resources for teachers, administrators, students, and families.
	In Austria, Learning platforms like Moodle and LMS are being used, as well as cloud solutions from companies such as Microsoft and Google.
	In Bhutan, the Ministry of Education (MoE) launched the Bhutan e-Learning program. This started on March 27, 2020 allows students from PreK-12 to access lessons through educational television as well as on YouTube. The broadcasting schedules are published on the MoE website. 
	In France, an online portal, Ma classe à la maison (My class at home) provides access to educational content and learning opportunities.

Lots and lots of example are there that countries have adopted to change the way of providing education.

Being a citizen of India, we can notice very well the poor condition of our remote education. Various efforts are put forward by the government but is perishing due to various factors such lack of communication or literacy in the remote areas. So, we (“Rockers”) as a group come up with a new idea that might not only help India but also prove advantageous to all the developing countries to come out of poverty and increase literacy rate.



IDEA:

As students, we very much understand the havoc this COVID-19 pandemic has created and we as a group (“Rockers”) come up with an idea that will work like a Non Profitable Organization and we named it as “Chip-sastra”. As a participant of #callforcode, we can utilize IBM cloud services to create a website that will help to analyze the stats of unprivileged children who really need help for their education. As we already know that money is not an ultimate solution, so we can start making “CHIP COURSES” which will help those who really wanted to learn in this pandemic and they are shuck in their home.

We as a Non Profitable Organization try to distribute such “CHIP COURSES” for free, so that one day they can bring the change.


 


BENEFITS:

	No internet connection needed.
	Simple and effective.
	Smart study.



“If you are giving money to help someone, you are doing a temporary solution but if you are educating someone you are trailing out his whole generation from poverty”.
